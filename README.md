Programming assignment in R for Coursera's Getting and cleaning data course

## run_analysis.R
This script downloads a dataset of accelerometer values collected from smartphones of 30 people (subjects) doing different activities; walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. The script selects only the accelerometer data that represents the mean and standard deviation of the measurement. The original data is divided into training and test sets and has the data on subject and activity in separate files. The script recombines the original data into one tidy data set (called merged_data).  From this tidy data set the script creates a second (called cast_data), independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
